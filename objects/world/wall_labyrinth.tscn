editor_description = "Delete this:

I have like 30 different wall .tscns, but I want to combine them into one placeable wall source.
It can auto-tile itself by looking at its neighbors.
It works in-editor.
And it can be \"locked\" so it doesn't auto-tile if I need it to be something specific.

And later:
A custom plugin to take auto-tile resources like this and make custom tile placements easier to manage would be nice.

One problem:
If these tiles have configurable properties, but are also members of a tilemaplayer, how do I configure them?
Maybe we don't use a tilemaplayer but instead a plugin for object placement."
