## Skills



## Spells

### Burn

A simple spell like this is a good idea to introduce the magic system. Players can imagine attacking something with fire, and we can mix in the synergies concept from there.

Players collect Burn. They may try using it on the first golem enemies. Those are stone, so it won't work. We begin by learning about Burn through its other effects.

*Later,* they'll see fleshy enemies. If they're clever enough to try using Burn again, they'll discover it *can* be used the way they first thought, but that they need to pay attention to a target's *properties*.

- Burn flammable enemies / materials.

- Light fuel / gas / etc.

- Multiple uses can melt metals / rocks.

### Shock

- Chain to nearby targets, if they're conductive.
  - This doesn't mean each target is damaged, but it can be a way to reach far away targets.
- Paralyze certain enemies, giving you time to fuff about.
- Energize / overclock certain machine-like targets.

### Crush

- Compactifies things.
  - Loose particulates can be compactified into a new floor tile.
- Increase atmospheric pressure.

### Crack

- Weaken/destroy enemy armor, then hit them with something else.
- Break floor tiles, which then behave like glass; step over them, leaving enemies behind a gap.
  - No soft-lock: you can fall in yourself, which will take you back to a labyrinth checkpoint.

### Raise

- Turn a floor tile into a weak wall. (Crack or Hammer to destroy)
  - Soft-locking: these should crumble over time?

- Block enemies / traps / lines of sight.

- Can lift objects to an upper floor?

- Can lift levers to an up position from far away?

### Control

- Cause a target to copy your movements.

- Manipulate devices, like levers, from far away.

### Stop (time)

- Freeze enemies / traps.

- Freeze water, allow water-walking.

- Stop aging:
  - Of perishables during a Zelda-like timed delivery quest?

### Death

- Rare.

- Kills anything instantly, excruciatingly.

- May be blocked once with Magic Barrier. Consecutive Deaths will overwhelm, however.

- Imbues targets with massive amounts of Decay.

- What if Death was cast on something immortal? The immortal tree.

### Solar

- Envelopes in holy energy.

- Illuminates dark or invisible things.

### Void

- Creates a 3x3 hole in space.

### Remember

- On any empty tile (besides you), creates a checkpoint you can respawn to. Max 1.
- Makes objects persistent? But persistent through what...

## Items

### Vial

Of something.

- Heals 2 hearts.

### Dial

- Slows the passage of time.



## Traps

### Bomb

Blows up 3x3 area.

Triggerable instantly with fire.

Blows up other bombs struck by this one.

### Bomb (proximity)

Arms first when you step near it.

Sometimes buried or hard to see until you arm it.

### Caustic Weather

Like Metroid Prime Echoes, you gotta hop between safe zones.
