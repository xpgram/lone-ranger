# Enemies

## Typical

### Mouth

I dunno. This is just the enemy from Void Stranger. I need new stuff.

## Bosses

### Wall of Death

A long hallway with a monster or scary-magic-thing of some kind on one end and an exit on the other.

You have to run along the hallway, solving golem-time traps and puzzles to get to the exit. Meanwhile, the wall encroaches on you in real-time.

The pace of this match is faster than typical real-time. He comes at you quick.

This could be the first real boss encountered. The game starts with turn-based golem time, then does a shock-twist reveal about its real-time, so this boss would be a fun play on both concepts and could represent your final challenge before leaving the game's beginning "golem trial zone".
