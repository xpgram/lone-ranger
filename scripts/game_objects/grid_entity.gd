extends Node2D
# TODO Can enemies, which are moved by script, be CharacterBody2D's? I think so, right?

# TODO I see this script being inherited by movable players, enemies, interactible chests,
#   pushable blocks, etc. This is the GameObject class, essentially.
#   I'm not sure what I want from it yet, though.
